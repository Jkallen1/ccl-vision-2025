                <p>
                    Custodial work plays a vital role in maintaining the cleanliness and overall appearance of our
                    campus. With the rising cost of tuition, CCL is always looking for ways to reduce expenses and offer
                    affordable education to our students. One solution is to hire student staff to maintain the campus
                    instead of outsourcing the work to third-party cleaning companies. We would like to save those fees
                    and redirect the funds towards lowering the tuition. This would entail our staff to maintain
                    hallways, bathrooms, and common areas. We want to make sure to protect our students by keeping our
                    surfaces disinfected and sustain a healthy environment. CCL has amazing natural lighting and a
                    wonderful view that student staff keep streak-free and shining brightly. Join our team to keep the
                    campus clean!

                    Our students are supported by our highly qualified tutors and teachers. Student Tutors can assist
                    with filling in gaps of the material that weren't fully understood in class. We train all of our
                    tutors to be experts in our CCL courses. We offer tutor led group sessions to encourage peer to peer
                    learning. CCL has beautiful spaces to accommodate both study groups and independent learners. We
                    also offer, but are not limited to, help with homework, one-on-one lesson reviews, and share
                    pro-tips for study skills. Apply for student tutor positions to help your peers while gaining
                    valuable experience and paying off your tuition.
